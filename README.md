# Automatically classify e-commerce products

### Mission

We were asked to study the feasibility of implementing an unsupervised model to classify products of an e-commerce platform. 

One of the main interests of this project is the feature extraction part, as the data contained non-tabular data (text and images) that led to the best performances.

After diving into "classical" methods in both NLP and Computer Vision fields for feature extraction (BOW, BOVW), we used more advanced techniques with deep learning (we used pre-trained models for word embeddings and several CNNs Architectures for Computer Vision).

Out of curiosity, we also evaluated the feasibility of a supervised model to classify products.
